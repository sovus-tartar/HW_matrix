# Matrix deteminant counter

## Brief

 This program accepts a matrix and outputs its determinant. 

 The calculations are based on Gaussian Algorithm with pivoting.

## Compilation

To make you may use CMake and gcc compiler. `CMakeLists.txt` included.


## Using

Example:

        ./HW_matrix 2 1 2 3 4

Such input means that you input the matrix contains 2 lines and 2 collumns:

       || 1 2 ||
       || 3 4 ||
